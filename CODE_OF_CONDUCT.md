# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of ch-rollup is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, or political affiliation.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to foster a sense of community and encourage constructive collaboration. Our contributors strive to make meaningful contributions to open source projects while respecting others' ideas, contributions, and work.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all contributors:

- Be respectful: Value each other’s ideas, styles, and viewpoints. Be inclusive of all backgrounds and perspectives.
- Be considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- Be collaborative: Work together. Collaboration enables individuals to learn from each other and create a better project together than any one individual could alone.
- Be open: Welcome newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. Open source communities thrive on diversity of thought and experience.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can contact it via [email](mailto:tech@ozon.ru).

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the project maintainers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
